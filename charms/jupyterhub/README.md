# Charmed Jupyterhub Slurm Operator
This charm is a POC for jupyterhub integration with the [slurm-charms](https://github.com/charmed-hpc/slurm-charms).

The charmed operator installs an nfs-server, jupyterhub server, and tailscale funnel on top of a working slurm deployment
to provide jupyterhub notebook servers to system level users.
